      "annotation": "This line, written by Paul McCartney, is a reference to the African American community\u2019s struggle for civil rights, especially in the 1960s.\n\nIt is a metaphor, comparing the plight of Black Americans in the 1960s to that of a blackbird learning to fly with broken wings.\n\nThe \u201cbroken wings\u201d represent how the community has been beaten down and oppressed. The phrase \u201clearn to fly\u201d is about how the community has the potential to arise and fight for their rights, and has been, just as the blackbird in the song is taking its wings, though they are damaged, and learning to fly with them.\n\nThe line draws particularly from the case of the \u201cLittle Rock Nine,\u201d nine brave Black students who attended a school in Arkansas that had previously been all White, planting themselves directly in the face of racism and discrimination.

      "annotation": "Despite Paul McCartney\u2019s optimism, flying with a broken wing, or seeing with sunken eyes, is very difficult. Ending segregation was important, but it didn\u2019t provide African Americans with equality\u2014their circumstances were still much worse than those of their white counterparts.\n\nToday, compared to white citizens, African Americans are less likely to own their own home, more likely to go to prison, and will earn less money on average. Ending segregation alone has not led to equality.",
