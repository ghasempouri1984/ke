      "annotation": "The persona\u2019s passivity in the prior lines is strengthened by his perception of self; whereby, describing oneself as a \u201cboy\u201d represents his regression to a helpless state. The inclusion of \u201cjust\u201d further informs his perceived insignificance.\n\nNevertheless, the persona qualifies this representation, expressing that an acknowledgement of his deeply helpless situation is not accompanied by self-pity (he is undesiring of \u201csympathy\u201d). Instead, he copes by adopting a passive outlook (represented by \u201ceasy come, easy go\u201d) and ultimately abandons the desire and hope to influence his life.\n\nSuch surrendering could be representational of the K\u00fcbler-Ross Grief Cycle\u2019s final stage (i.e.acceptance)  to which the persona accepts a new way of life in light of great previous loss/suffering.",
      "lyrics": "Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me"

      "annotation": "He (Freddie Mercury, as the protagonist-character of the song), is both lyrically and metaphorically saying goodbye, a decision to go to where no rock/pop song would dare go,\n to \u201cface the truth\", perhaps capital punishment?\n\nThese lines take us closer to the surreality of a case whose jurisdiction is in opera-court drama-Hell, a musical thrill ride, whether perceived as scary, comedic or both, it\u2019s a rhapsodic trip.\n\n\u201cGoodbye \u2026 I\u2019ve got to go\" (to \u201cface the truth\u201d, possibly death!?):\n\nBack to the mundane re-statement of the lines, he must face the repercussions of his crime.  After all, he \u201cjust killed a man\u201d.  Motive?  Pre-meditated? In self-defense?  Or \u2026 (twistedly) suicide?\nIf \u201che\u201d himself was the \u201cman\u201d he killed, metaphorically, then lyrically self-defense is plausible, given the (generally) accepted interpretation of the song.  Suicide might land one in a Hellish after-life, according to, uh, divine laws?  But re-direct: the \u201ckilling\u201d is of a personal false \u201cfacade\u201d and how is that murderous, if the truth sets one (and others) free?  Unless it lands you in jail, like, say, Galileo, who dared to spread his sphere-theory, blasphemous to the false-divinity of flat-earth gravity.\n\nIs \u201cFreddie\u201d off to some sphere of a circuit court, to pull a lyrical joke on us?  Objection! Irrelevant.  It doesn\u2019t matter.  Because \u201cnothing really matters\u201d?  Over-ruled; because later, did the judgy-jurists let him go?  \u2018No, no, no, no, no, no, no!\"\n\nBut \u201cgoodbye everybody\u201d, he\u2019s got to go; i.e., the song must move, conclusively.  The journey proceeds after a few more lyric-lines and past the bridge of Brian May\u2019s first guitar-solo to Freddie\u2019s piano staccatos, into a silhouetted deep dip into a La-La-land of mock-opera (as ode-to opera) madness.   Going there was and remains curious, musically/vocally stunning, and \u2026 risky, in conflated financial and artistic proportions.\n\n\u201cGoodbye, everybody; I\u2019ve got to go \u2026 to face the truth\u201d.  The truth lies in our own choice to shut up or write too much about nothing.\n\nOne verdict could be construed as compensatory damages (back in \u201creality-land\u201d, where money rules):\nRhapsodically, the court of music consumers longing for Bohemia ordained Queen as the people\u2018s band; with this song, Freddie & Co. said \u201cgoodbye\u201d to being \u201cstarving artists\u201d, or rather oddly \u201cstarving rock stars\u201d (an unfair predicament).\n\nCiting the song\u2019s success as some form of lyrical \u201cverdict\u201d is an unsatisfying stretch, true, but this song ran with it.   Within 6-minutes, it (and its album) afforded the band to go globe-trotting, show-stomping from stage to stage, with inevitable \u201cgoodbyes!\u201d to many bodies in between.\n\nIf the wind had blown failure, then to fail BIG would\u2019ve mattered as much to the band.  Goodbye everybody, keep going as if nothing or everything really matters.",
      "lyrics": "Too late, my time has come Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows) I don't wanna die I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all"

      "annotation": "In this line, the persona simultaneously embodies \u201cmonstrosity\u201d and is a victim of it.\n\nExplicitly, the prevailing regressional tone (e.g. \u201cboy\u201d and \u201cmama\u201d) paints him as passive and powerless. In this sense, the line is a third party\u2019s plea to spare an innocent child\u2019s life of great suffering.\n\nConversely, the persona\u2019s parallels with Scaramouche (i.e. a clown with villainous tendencies) coupled with the assertion that \u201cBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me\u201d, suggests that he is capable of inflicting great pain and \u2018sin\u2019. Thus, the line presents him as the monster and pertains to either the plea to relieve him from a destructive life or the shame of being perceived as a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d (i.e. the metaphor serves to portray how alienated he feels).\n\nThe duality of being may serve to portray the conflict between societal perceptions (that perceive him as a monster) and true character, stemming from various zeitgeists/prejudices. The disconnect seems to alienate the persona and contributes to his figurative and/or literal demise.\n\n\n\nScaramouche",
