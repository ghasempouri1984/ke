The phrase “learn to fly” is about how the community has the potential to arise and fight for their rights, and has been, just as the blackbird in the song is taking its wings, though they are damaged, and learning to fly with them.\n\nThe line draws particularly from the case of the “Little Rock Nine,” nine brave Black students who attended a school in Arkansas that had previously been all White, planting themselves directly in the face of racism and discrimination.

Ending segregation was important, but it didn’t provide African Americans with equality—their circumstances were still much worse than those of their white counterparts.\n\nToday, compared to white citizens, African Americans are less likely to own their own home, more likely to go to prison, and will earn less money on average.
