    mm:hasAnnotation """The persona�s passivity in the prior lines is strengthened by his perception of self; whereby, describing oneself as a �boy� represents his regression to a helpless state. The inclusion of �just� further informs his perceived insignificance.

Nevertheless, the persona qualifies this representation, expressing that an acknowledgement of his deeply helpless situation is not accompanied by self-pity (he is undesiring of �sympathy�). Instead, he copes by adopting a passive outlook (represented by �easy come, easy go�) and ultimately abandons the desire and hope to influence his life.

Such surrendering could be representational of the K�bler-Ross Grief Cycle�s final stage (i.e.acceptance)  to which the persona accepts a new way of life in light of great previous loss/suffering.""" ;

    mm:hasAnnotation """He (Freddie Mercury, as the protagonist-character of the song), is both lyrically and metaphorically saying goodbye, a decision to go to where no rock/pop song would dare go,
 to �face the truth", perhaps capital punishment?

These lines take us closer to the surreality of a case whose jurisdiction is in opera-court drama-Hell, a musical thrill ride, whether perceived as scary, comedic or both, it�s a rhapsodic trip.

�Goodbye � I�ve got to go" (to �face the truth�, possibly death!?):

Back to the mundane re-statement of the lines, he must face the repercussions of his crime.  After all, he �just killed a man�.  Motive?  Pre-meditated? In self-defense?  Or � (twistedly) suicide?
If �he� himself was the �man� he killed, metaphorically, then lyrically self-defense is plausible, given the (generally) accepted interpretation of the song.  Suicide might land one in a Hellish after-life, according to, uh, divine laws?  But re-direct: the �killing� is of a personal false �facade� and how is that murderous, if the truth sets one (and others) free?  Unless it lands you in jail, like, say, Galileo, who dared to spread his sphere-theory, blasphemous to the false-divinity of flat-earth gravity.

Is �Freddie� off to some sphere of a circuit court, to pull a lyrical joke on us?  Objection! Irrelevant.  It doesn�t matter.  Because �nothing really matters�?  Over-ruled; because later, did the judgy-jurists let him go?  �No, no, no, no, no, no, no!"

But �goodbye everybody�, he�s got to go; i.e., the song must move, conclusively.  The journey proceeds after a few more lyric-lines and past the bridge of Brian May�s first guitar-solo to Freddie�s piano staccatos, into a silhouetted deep dip into a La-La-land of mock-opera (as ode-to opera) madness.   Going there was and remains curious, musically/vocally stunning, and � risky, in conflated financial and artistic proportions.

�Goodbye, everybody; I�ve got to go � to face the truth�.  The truth lies in our own choice to shut up or write too much about nothing.

One verdict could be construed as compensatory damages (back in �reality-land�, where money rules):
Rhapsodically, the court of music consumers longing for Bohemia ordained Queen as the people�s band; with this song, Freddie & Co. said �goodbye� to being �starving artists�, or rather oddly �starving rock stars� (an unfair predicament).

Citing the song�s success as some form of lyrical �verdict� is an unsatisfying stretch, true, but this song ran with it.   Within 6-minutes, it (and its album) afforded the band to go globe-trotting, show-stomping from stage to stage, with inevitable �goodbyes!� to many bodies in between.

If the wind had blown failure, then to fail BIG would�ve mattered as much to the band.  Goodbye everybody, keep going as if nothing or everything really matters.""" ;

    mm:hasAnnotation """In this line, the persona simultaneously embodies �monstrosity� and is a victim of it.

Explicitly, the prevailing regressional tone (e.g. �boy� and �mama�) paints him as passive and powerless. In this sense, the line is a third party�s plea to spare an innocent child�s life of great suffering.

Conversely, the persona�s parallels with Scaramouche (i.e. a clown with villainous tendencies) coupled with the assertion that �Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me�, suggests that he is capable of inflicting great pain and �sin�. Thus, the line presents him as the monster and pertains to either the plea to relieve him from a destructive life or the shame of being perceived as a �monstrosity� (i.e. the metaphor serves to portray how alienated he feels).

The duality of being may serve to portray the conflict between societal perceptions (that perceive him as a monster) and true character, stemming from various zeitgeists/prejudices. The disconnect seems to alienate the persona and contributes to his figurative and/or literal demise.
