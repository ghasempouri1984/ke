    mm:hasAnnotation """This song, composed entirely by Paul McCartney, came to him in a dream. He awoke one night while staying in a London attic for the filming of Help!:

I got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th � and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot, but because I�d dreamed it, I couldn�t believe I�d written it. I thought, �No, I�ve never written anything like this before.� But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing!

The melody came to McCartney much quicker than lyrical inspiration. In order to arrange the song, he quickly scribbled out placeholder lyrics. Thus, �Yesterday� originally had the working title �Scrambled Eggs,� and opened with:

Scrambled eggs
Oh my baby, how I love your legs

McCartney would subsequently write �Yellow Submarine� in bed, and John Lennon would also stumble upon �Nowhere Man� and �Across The Universe� in dreams. McCartney would later observe:

When you�re trying to write a song, there are certain times when you get the essence, it�s all there. It�s like an egg being laid � not a crack or a flaw in it.""" ;

This song is one of the biggest signs that the Beatles were changing, instead of the rock in roll and ballads of the past they presented a melancholy string song with a true heart to it, seen throughout the whole album �Help� really.

This line especially has always stuck with me. The song in question represents this quelling sadness in this �shadow that is hanging over him. Yesterday coming suddenly gave the song a harsher more personal feel, the desperation to go back to what was only just lost, and the spontaneity of it all. A beautiful line by Paul.""" ;

I remember mulling over the tune �Yesterday�, and suddenly getting these little one-word openings to the verse. I started to develop the idea � da-da da, yes-ter-day, sud-den-ly, fun-il-ly, mer-il-ly and Yes-ter-day, that�s good. All my troubles seemed so far away.

It�s easy to rhyme those a�s: say, nay, today, away, play, stay, there�s a lot of rhymes and those fall in quite easily, so I gradually pieced it together from that journey. Sud-den-ly, and �b� again, another easy rhyme: e, me, tree, flea, we, and I had the basis of it.""" ;
