    mm:hasAnnotation """This line, written by Paul McCartney, is a reference to the African American community�s struggle for civil rights, especially in the 1960s.

It is a metaphor, comparing the plight of Black Americans in the 1960s to that of a blackbird learning to fly with broken wings.

The �broken wings� represent how the community has been beaten down and oppressed. The phrase �learn to fly� is about how the community has the potential to arise and fight for their rights, and has been, just as the blackbird in the song is taking its wings, though they are damaged, and learning to fly with them.

The line draws particularly from the case of the �Little Rock Nine,� nine brave Black students who attended a school in Arkansas that had previously been all White, planting themselves directly in the face of racism and discrimination. (More can be read about this through the first link below.)

Ending segregation was important, but it didn�t provide African Americans with equality�their circumstances were still much worse than those of their white counterparts.

Today, compared to white citizens, African Americans are less likely to own their own home, more likely to go to prison, and will earn less money on average. Ending segregation alone has not led to equality.""" ;
