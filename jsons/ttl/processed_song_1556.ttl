The phrase \uFFFDlearn to fly\uFFFD is about how the community has the potential to arise and fight for their rights, and has been, just as the blackbird in the song is taking its wings, though they are damaged, and learning to fly with them.\n\nThe line draws particularly from the case of the \uFFFDLittle Rock Nine,\uFFFD nine brave Black students who attended a school in Arkansas that had previously been all White, planting themselves directly in the face of racism and discrimination.
