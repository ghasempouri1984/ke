        ex:annotation  "He (Freddie Mercury, as the protagonist-character of the song), is both lyrically and metaphorically saying goodbye, a decision to go to where no rock/pop song would dare go,\n to \uFFFDface the truth\", perhaps capital punishment?\n\nThese lines take us closer to the surreality of a case whose jurisdiction is in opera-court drama-Hell, a musical thrill ride, whether perceived as scary, comedic or both, it\uFFFDs a rhapsodic trip.\n\n\uFFFDGoodbye \uFFFD I\uFFFDve got to go\" (to \uFFFDface the truth\uFFFD, possibly death!?):\n\nBack to the mundane re-statement of the lines, he must face the repercussions of his crime.  After all, he \uFFFDjust killed a man\uFFFD.  Motive?  Pre-meditated? In self-defense?  Or \uFFFD (twistedly) suicide?\nIf \uFFFDhe\uFFFD himself was the \uFFFDman\uFFFD he killed, metaphorically, then lyrically self-defense is plausible, given the (generally) accepted interpretation of the song.  Suicide might land one in a Hellish after-life, according to, uh, divine laws?  But re-direct: the \uFFFDkilling\uFFFD is of a personal false \uFFFDfacade\uFFFD and how is that murderous, if the truth sets one (and others) free?  Unless it lands you in jail, like, say, Galileo, who dared to spread his sphere-theory, blasphemous to the false-divinity of flat-earth gravity.\n\nIs \uFFFDFreddie\uFFFD off to some sphere of a circuit court, to pull a lyrical joke on us?  Objection! Irrelevant.  It doesn\uFFFDt matter.  Because \uFFFDnothing really matters\uFFFD?  Over-ruled; because later, did the judgy-jurists let him go?  \uFFFDNo, no, no, no, no, no, no!\"\n\nBut \uFFFDgoodbye everybody\uFFFD, he\uFFFDs got to go; i.e., the song must move, conclusively.  The journey proceeds after a few more lyric-lines and past the bridge of Brian May\uFFFDs first guitar-solo to Freddie\uFFFDs piano staccatos, into a silhouetted deep dip into a La-La-land of mock-opera (as ode-to opera) madness.   Going there was and remains curious, musically/vocally stunning, and \uFFFD risky, in conflated financial and artistic proportions.\n\n\uFFFDGoodbye, everybody; I\uFFFDve got to go \uFFFD to face the truth\uFFFD.  The truth lies in our own choice to shut up or write too much about nothing.\n\nOne verdict could be construed as compensatory damages (back in \uFFFDreality-land\uFFFD, where money rules):\nRhapsodically, the court of music consumers longing for Bohemia ordained Queen as the people\uFFFDs band; with this song, Freddie & Co. said \uFFFDgoodbye\uFFFD to being \uFFFDstarving artists\uFFFD, or rather oddly \uFFFDstarving rock stars\uFFFD (an unfair predicament).\n\nCiting the song\uFFFDs success as some form of lyrical \uFFFDverdict\uFFFD is an unsatisfying stretch, true, but this song ran with it.   Within 6-minutes, it (and its album) afforded the band to go globe-trotting, show-stomping from stage to stage, with inevitable \uFFFDgoodbyes!\uFFFD to many bodies in between.\n\nIf the wind had blown failure, then to fail BIG would\uFFFDve mattered as much to the band.  Goodbye everybody, keep going as if nothing or everything really matters." ;

In this sense, the line is a third party\uFFFDs plea to spare an innocent child\uFFFDs life of great suffering.\n\nConversely, the persona\uFFFDs parallels with Scaramouche (i.e. a clown with villainous tendencies) coupled with the assertion that \uFFFDBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me\uFFFD, suggests that he is capable of inflicting great pain and \uFFFDsin\uFFFD. Thus, the line presents him as the monster and pertains to either the plea to relieve him from a destructive life or the shame of being perceived as a \uFFFDmonstrosity\uFFFD (i.e. the metaphor serves to portray how alienated he feels).\n\nThe duality of being may serve to portray the conflict between societal perceptions (that perceive him as a monster) and true character, stemming from various zeitgeists/prejudices. The disconnect seems to alienate the persona and contributes to his figurative and/or literal demise.\n\n\n\nScaramouche" ;
