I started to develop the idea \uFFFD da-da da, yes-ter-day, sud-den-ly, fun-il-ly, mer-il-ly and Yes-ter-day, that\uFFFDs good. All my troubles seemed so far away.\n\nIt\uFFFDs easy to rhyme those a\uFFFDs: say, nay, today, away, play, stay, there\uFFFDs a lot of rhymes and those fall in quite easily, so I gradually pieced it together from that journey. Sud-den-ly, and \uFFFDb\uFFFD again, another easy rhyme: e, me, tree, flea, we, and I had the basis of it." ;

He awoke one night while staying in a London attic for the filming of Help!:\n\nI got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th \uFFFD and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot, but because I\uFFFDd dreamed it, I couldn\uFFFDt believe I\uFFFDd written it. I thought, \uFFFDNo, I\uFFFDve never written anything like this before.\uFFFD But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing!\n\nThe melody came to McCartney much quicker than lyrical inspiration. In order to arrange the song, he quickly scribbled out placeholder lyrics. Thus, \uFFFDYesterday\uFFFD originally had the working title \uFFFDScrambled Eggs,\uFFFD and opened with:\n\nScrambled eggs\nOh my baby, how I love your legs\n\nMcCartney would subsequently write \uFFFDYellow Submarine\uFFFD in bed, and John Lennon would also stumble upon \uFFFDNowhere Man\uFFFD and \uFFFDAcross The Universe\uFFFD in dreams. McCartney would later observe:\n\nWhen you\uFFFDre trying to write a song, there are certain times when you get the essence, it\uFFFDs all there. It\uFFFDs like an egg being laid \uFFFD not a crack or a flaw in it." ;

The song in question represents this quelling sadness in this \uFFFDshadow that is hanging over him. Yesterday coming suddenly gave the song a harsher more personal feel, the desperation to go back to what was only just lost, and the spontaneity of it all. A beautiful line by Paul." ;
