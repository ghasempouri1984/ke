      "annotation": "This song, composed entirely by Paul McCartney, came to him in a dream. He awoke one night while staying in a London attic for the filming of Help!:\n\nI got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th \u2013 and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot, but because I\u2019d dreamed it, I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d written it. I thought, \u2018No, I\u2019ve never written anything like this before.\u2019 But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing!\n\nThe melody came to McCartney much quicker than lyrical inspiration. In order to arrange the song, he quickly scribbled out placeholder lyrics. Thus, \u201cYesterday\u201d originally had the working title \u201cScrambled Eggs,\u201d and opened with:\n\nScrambled eggs\nOh my baby, how I love your legs\n\nMcCartney would subsequently write \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d in bed, and John Lennon would also stumble upon \u201cNowhere Man\u201d and \u201cAcross The Universe\u201d in dreams. McCartney would later observe:\n\nWhen you\u2019re trying to write a song, there are certain times when you get the essence, it\u2019s all there. It\u2019s like an egg being laid \u2013 not a crack or a flaw in it.",

      "annotation": "George Martin had been the one to recommend a string quartet after John Lennon and George Harrison didn\u2019t see the need for more guitars on the track and Ringo thought the same for the drums.\n\nThis song is one of the biggest signs that the Beatles were changing, instead of the rock in roll and ballads of the past they presented a melancholy string song with a true heart to it, seen throughout the whole album \u2018Help\u2019 really.\n\nThis line especially has always stuck with me. The song in question represents this quelling sadness in this \u2018shadow that is hanging over him. Yesterday coming suddenly gave the song a harsher more personal feel, the desperation to go back to what was only just lost, and the spontaneity of it all. A beautiful line by Paul.",

      "annotation": "In a biography about Paul McCartney, it was theorized that this song was actually an homage to his late mother, Mary\u2013rather than a lost girlfriend or spouse; which is almost a little more depressing.\n\nPaul wrote the song while he was still in a committed relationship with Jane Asher  in 1964, though this partnership would dissolve four years later, in 1968.",

      "annotation": "In the October 1997 Paul McCartney biography, Many Years From Now by Barry Miles, McCartney was said to have finalized the lyrics during a trip to Portugal in May 1965:\n\n\nI remember mulling over the tune \u2018Yesterday\u2019, and suddenly getting these little one-word openings to the verse. I started to develop the idea \u2026 da-da da, yes-ter-day, sud-den-ly, fun-il-ly, mer-il-ly and Yes-ter-day, that\u2019s good. All my troubles seemed so far away.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to rhyme those a\u2019s: say, nay, today, away, play, stay, there\u2019s a lot of rhymes and those fall in quite easily, so I gradually pieced it together from that journey. Sud-den-ly, and \u2018b\u2019 again, another easy rhyme: e, me, tree, flea, we, and I had the basis of it.",
